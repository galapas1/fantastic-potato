              The expected service life of various construction and preservation/rehabilitation treatments available depends greatly on if the pavement sections will be new construction, reconstruction, or an overlay of an existing pavement. For example, typical performance periods for new asphalt pavements and new concrete pavements are 8-25 years and 20-40 years, respectively. When designing a <em>comparable</em> new asphalt pavement, the design lives need to be equal for the asphalt and concrete alternates to generate comparable designs. Expected service lives of different types of concrete and asphalt overlays are available elsewhere.</div>
