                Directional distribution is typically 50% (a 50-50 split between traffic going in each direction on the roadway). But in some cases, a difference in traffic patterns may necessitate a directional distribution other than 50%, such as a particular area generating more trips over a long period of time than the number of trips that it attracts.</div>
